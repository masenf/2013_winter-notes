What is an object?
==================

An object is a black box composed of:

  * Data (Referred to as *Attributes*)
  * Behavior (Referred to as *methods*, *operations*, or *messages accepted*)

What is a class?
================

A class is a specification (blueprint) which defines a type of object.

The class definition describes the attributes and methods which compose a type of object.

Reedy likes the cookie-cutter analogy: 

    A class is like a cookie-cutter. An object is like a cookie.

In Java, reflection is available: getClass() returns the class of the
object that it's called on as an object itself.

Encapsulation and data hiding
=============================

Good practice: **All attributes are private**

This prevents other code from directly probing or modifying the internal data.
Callers can only manipulate the data via method calls on the object: 
"getters" and "setters".
