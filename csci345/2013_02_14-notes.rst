CSCI 345 Notes 2013/02/14
=========================

* Open/Close principle

  * Classes should be *open* for extension and *closed* for modification
  * If new functionality is needed, a new class should be created
  * Two options:

    * New class extends existing class
    * Existing class implements published interface, create new interface (may be extended),
      new class implements both the new and published interfaces

  * The goal is to avoid breaking existing functionality while maintaining the
    flexibility to improve and extend the program

    Side note: Think of an interface at a *pure abstract class*: an abstract class with only
    abstract methods.

* Class should be responsible for itself
* Keep scope as small as possible
* Keep coupling low: this helps to isolate changes and avoid recompilation
* Provide standard operations
