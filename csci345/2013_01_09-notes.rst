Object oriented design, day one... Will anything useful happen?

Enrollment code: 75952

Where do objects come from? The stork.

Example: A payroll system
-------------------------

* Common attributes

  * Name
  * SSN
  * etc

* Weekly (Exempt)

  * $W/week

* Hourly (Non-Exempt)

  * $H / hour
  * $1.50 * H / hour (over 40)

We have two different kinds of employees with different payroll calculation
algorithms, although everything else is the same...

Data Structure #1
=================

  * Tag -- employee type
  * Employee details (name, SSN, etc)
  * Hourly hours
  * Weekly hours

The hourly and weekly hours are *non-semantic* attributes, they don't always
have meaning in every possible context. No compile time checking of correctness.
This method is definitely possible, but fraught with peril -- 
higher liklihood that the programmer will create bugs. More opportunities ==
more bugs.

Data Structure #2
=================

+----------------+
|Tag             |
+----------------+
|common          |
+--------+-------+
|hourly  | weekly|
+--------+-------+

This is a variant record in Ada or a union in C. These structures are unchecked
in C.
