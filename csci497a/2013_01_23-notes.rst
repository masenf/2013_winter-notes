Snyders type architecture
=========================

* P processors with local memory
* fixed number of edges
* communication net (Fixed Degree graph!)
* global controller

Hypercube? No, edges not fixed.

Network of Workstations? Yes, fairly closely.

An algorithm written for Snyders type architecture can run on *any* parallel machine
that exists.

The important takeaway is that the medium is the message. Starting with the wrong
architecture in mind, produces sub par code. Parallel code doesn't give that much
of a speedup normally, so not optimizing for *the* parallel architecture is a
major source of overhead.
