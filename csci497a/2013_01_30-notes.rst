Algorithms: Dense Matrix
========================

Most of the time implemented as an O(n^3) algorithm. There have been 
algorithms which are asymptotically faster, however the constant term 
is large, making them useful on large martricies.

Partitioning Methods
--------------------

* Striped: single row or column to one PE

    * Block: contiguous rows or columns
    * Cyclic

* Checkerboard:

    * Block: rectangular sub-matrix
    * Cyclic
