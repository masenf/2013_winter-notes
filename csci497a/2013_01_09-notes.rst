Classes of Parallel computers
=============================

SIMD - Single instruction, multiple data:
    All CPUs execute the same instruction at the same time. Parallel
    computation achieved by processing different data by each core

    **Application**: graphics processing
MIMD - Multiple instruction, multiple data:
    Each cpu has it's own program and data. Sync via communication.
    CPU access to memory.
SPMD - Single program multiple data (Not really a parallel computer)
    Not necessarily the *same* instruction, but usually the same
    program.

    Usually run on MIMD machine; runs well on cluster or multi-core CPU

Communication
=============

Shared Memory Theoretical Model
-------------------------------

* One memory, Many CPUs -- must syncronize for access
* Cache coherence problems
* PRAM -- hypothetical random access machine with infinite memory and
  infinite word size.

  * Concurrent read/write among **n** CPUs -- everyone can read and write
    to memory without locking. 

    * Common write: all processors must write the same value to the same
      memory location if they are writing concurrently
    * Arbitrary write: one CPU just *wins*
    * Priority: use a fixed value, like CPU number to break write ties.

  * Exclusive read/write -- no two processors can read/write the same
    memory location at the same time.
  * Concurrent read/Exclusive write (CREW PRAM) - if any one processor 
    is writing to a memory location, no other processor can read or write
    that location.

Non-shared Memory
-----------------
* Each CPU with private memory
* Communication network -> message passing
  
  * Bus based (broadcast, limited bandwidth, cheap)
  * Crossbar switch (full bandwidth, expensive)
  * multistage crossover
  * completely connected
  * star
  * mesh
    
    * linear, 2-d mesh, 3-d mesh (weather), hypercube

  * trees

    * fat tree -- the higher up the tree, the more bandwidth is available
      per node.

Network of Workstations
=======================

This is the common *"parallel machine"* today.

Connections
-----------
  * High speed switch (or more)
  * High speed ether

WWU Compute Cluster
-------------------
  * Network of custom built nodes
  * 1 head node (12 Cores, 2 CPU)
  * 8 compute nodes (12 Cores, 2 CPU)
  * 2 GPU nodes (12 Core, 2 CPU, 3 GPU)
  * 1 storage node (8 Cores, 2 CPU)
