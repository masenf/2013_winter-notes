Communication Operations (con't)

**All to All personalized** -- unique messages: finding the transpose of a 
matrix in parallel

Look these up in the book...

Ring: "take one, pass the rest"

    If we have *n* processors, then we're sending *n-1* messages, and the
    size of each message is *n-1*, *n-2*, ... *1*. This is O(n^2).

Mesh: O(p sqrt(p))

Hypercube: O(p lg(p))

Crossbar: O(p)

**All to All reduce**

Crossbar::

    R <- D[id]
    for i = 1 to p-1
            SEND D[(id+i) % p] to Processor (id+1) % p
            RECV from (id+1) % p
                R op Recv.Data

At the end of the calculation, each processor, p has an R value that corresponds to
the reduction of D[p] across all processors.

The entire operation is O(p). Note that a standard All -> 1 reduction is O(p lg(p))
