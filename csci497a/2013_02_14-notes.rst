More on blocks
==============

Upon kernel call, all threads are started at once

The total number of threads in a block is limited to the number of threads
available on an SM (hardware dependent).

A single block cannot span SMs, but an SM may host several blocks

Blocks can be of arbitrary size, but it's beneficial if they are as large
or larger than the *warp* size. Blocks are split into warps, warps take
turns running, so if block size is 1, then only one thread runs at a time.
