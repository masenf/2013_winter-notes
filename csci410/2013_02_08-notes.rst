Midterm Review

Next monday:

Lexical analysis and flex
-------------------------

* Regular expressions
* How does Flex resolve ambiguity in patterns

  * Maximum munch
  * First pattern declared in the rules

Context-free grammars and deterministic Parsing
-----------------------------------------------

* Determine if a grammar is ambiguous or not: yes if an output string can
  be generated in more than one way
* Determine if a grammar is LL(1) from First and Follow sets.

  * If the First and Follow sets are disjoint, the grammar is LL(1)

* Empty string will never occur is Follow set
* $ always occurs in Follow(S)
* Calculating the follow set only makes sense for grammar rules which can
  derive the empty string.

* Must be able to build item set for LR(0)
* Must be able to identify type of conflict.

* What is an LR(1) grammar? Uses the item set, but each item also provides
  a *context* which is the follow set of the Non-terminal.
