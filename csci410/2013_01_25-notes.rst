Parsing
=======

There are two main types of parser:

  * Top-down: start with the Start symbol of the grammer and try to expand non-terminals
    to derive the input string
  * Bottom-up: start with the input string and try to reduce terminal symbols to
    non-terminals until you're left with the start string.

Top-down
--------

Relies on backtracking to correct bad expansion decisions

*Predictive Top-Down Parsing* is a technique for looking ahead at the next 
character to expand the proper non-terminal in a deterministic way.

LL(1), left-most, look-ahead 1 char:
  
  * Cannot be left-recursive, all terminal symbols in a production must appear before
    non-terminals
  * Must be left-factored

Ex::

    Left-recursive grammar (NOT LL(1))

        S   ->      Sa | b

    Convert to left-factored grammar

        S   ->      bT
        T   ->      aT | ^
